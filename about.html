        <p class="About1">
            “Bengaluru’s Best Bakes” was founded in 2023 by the Sharma family. Our passion for baking and commitment to using only the highest quality ingredients has made us a beloved fixture in the Bengaluru community. We believe in the power of food to bring people together and strive to create a warm, welcoming environment for all our customers.
            Bengaluru’s Best Bites is a locally owned and operated bakery that brings the authentic taste of Bengaluru to your doorstep. 
    
            Our journey began in the heart of Bengaluru, where we first opened our doors to the public. Since then, we have been committed to serving our community with delicious and fresh baked goods that are made from scratch every day.
    
            We believe in using only the finest ingredients to create our pastries, breads, and other baked goods. Our team of skilled bakers and pastry chefs work tirelessly to ensure that every bite you take is a testament to our commitment to quality.
    
            At Bengaluru’s Best Bites, we offer a wide range of products, from artisanal breads and pastries to local favorites like Bengaluru Buns. We also offer DIY baking kits for those who want to enjoy the fun of baking at home.
    
            We are more than just a bakery - we are a part of the Bengaluru community. We believe in giving back to the community that has given us so much. That’s why we source our ingredients from local farmers and suppliers, and actively participate in local events. <br>
